# Nbody Gravity Simulator
Implements the Barnesâ€“Hut algorithim to handle the gravitional interaction of over a million particles in 3D space. Currently set up to generate disks of particles 
Includes a renderer that produces high quailty PPM images of each step of the simulation. These can be compiled into animations using software like ffmpeg. [Example](https://goo.gl/uUEgHl)
